/**
 * Placeholder test file for AuthContext.
 *
 * The project's test runner and testing-library are not installed in this environment,
 * which causes TypeScript to fail resolving modules and test globals. To run the
 * real tests locally, install dev dependencies and restore the original test contents:
 *
 * npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest
 *
 * Then run the tests with your preferred runner (vitest or jest).
